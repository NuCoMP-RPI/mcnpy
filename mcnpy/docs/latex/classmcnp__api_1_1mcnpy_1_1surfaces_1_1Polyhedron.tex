\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An Arbitrary \mbox{\hyperlink{classmcnp__api_1_1mcnpy_1_1surfaces_1_1Polyhedron}{Polyhedron}}. 

There must be eight triplets of entries input for the ARB to describe the (x,y,z) of the corners, although some may not be used (just use triplets of zeros). These are followed by six more entries, ni, which follow a prescribed convention\+: each entry is a four-\/digit integer that defines a side of the ARB in terms of the corners for the side. For example, the entry 1278 would define this plane surface to be bounded by the first, second, seventh, and eighth triplets (or equivalently, corners). Since three points are sufficient to determine the plane, only the first, second, and seventh corners would be used in this example to determine the plane. The distance from the plane to the fourth corner (corner 8 in the example) is determined by MCNP6. If the absolute value of this distance is greater than 1.\+0E-\/6, an error message is given and the distance is printed in the OUTP file along with the (x,y,z) that would lie on the plane. If the fourth digit is zero, the fourth point is ignored. For a four-\/sided ARB, four non-\/zero four-\/digit integers (last digit is zero for four-\/sided since there are only three corners for each side) are required to define the sides. For a five-\/sided ARB, five non-\/zero four-\/digit integers are required, and six non-\/zero four-\/digit integers are required for a six-\/sided ARB. Since there must be 30 entries altogether for an ARB (or MCNP6 gives an error message), the last two integers are zero for the four-\/sided ARB and the last integer is zero for a five-\/sided ARB.
